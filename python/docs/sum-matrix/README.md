# Challenge Title
Sum Matrix

## Whiteboard Process

[Whiteboard](./sum-matrix.py)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
My approach was to have a for loop in an for loop to get all the values you needed to sum the specific index.
This is a linear function if it worked.

## Solution
To run this code you need to give it a matrix, but this code isn't complete so I will not return anything.
