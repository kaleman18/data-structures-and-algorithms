Stack and Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
this is a linear function beacuse it just matters about the size of the lists that get submitted

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you just need to call the method in the class and pass some data as the paramater to add a value to the Queue or Stack.
